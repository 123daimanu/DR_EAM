## Contains scripts used for my research. The scripts are written in bash and python.
1. **Elastic Constant**: Has bash script which generates different crystal sizes to calculate the Young's and Bulk's modulus of elasticity.
2. **Image Charge** : Has python script used to drag a ion from the surface of the slab up to certain height and test image charge effect.
3. **KTuning**: Has python and bash srcripts for tuing the harmoic self potential.
4. **L10**: Contains bash and python scripts to study L10 structures.
5. **L12**: Contains bash and python scripts to study L12 structures.
6. **Momentum_Distribution** : Contains python script that help to study angular momentum and liner momentum distribution. It predicts the temperature for the given maxwell-boltzman distribtution
7. **Pure_Crystals**: Contains bash and python script to study properties of pure crystals.
8.**Water_Adsorption_Script**: Contains bash and python scripts to get the information for the water-adsoprtion on metal surface to tune the parameters for water-metal potential.
